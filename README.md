# CUDA-Scalar-Vector
Developed a CUDA program that computes a scalar vector product and an element by element product of vectors. Inputs data read by the host (GPU) and outputs data written to a text file by the host. The program launches an appropriate amount of threads and block of threads based on the input file.
