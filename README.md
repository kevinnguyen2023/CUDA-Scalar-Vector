# CUDA-Scalar-Vector
Developed a program that computes a scalar vector product and an element by element product of vectors in CUDA. Tested and debugged input data through scanning the text file by the CPU host Google Cloud Platform. The program launches an appropriate amount of threads and block of threads based on the input file in the virtual machine.
